# ü§ñ About Me
Hi, I'm **Prabhjot Khera** ‚Äî a 3rd year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.  
My passion lies in **robotics**, **embedded systems**, and **machine vision**, where I enjoy building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.

üß† Currently exploring real-time systems, low-level firmware, point cloud processing, and multi-threaded C++ applications.

## üõ† Experience Highlights

### üîç Machine Vision Intern @ Taymer (Current)
- Building a **multi-threaded C++ application** for real-time **defect detection** on point cloud data using **OpenCV**, **YOLOv8**, **TensorRT**, and **CUDA**.
- Created **GPU-accelerated surface normal estimation** using **custom CUDA kernels**, achieving **91% accuracy** in identifying manufacturing defects.

### üß™ Research Assistant @ University of Waterloo
- Worked under **Dr. Yash Pant** in the **Control, Logic, and Learning (CL2)** group.
- Developed autonomous flight systems for **Crazyflie drones** using **ROS2**, **Python**, and **Vicon motion capture**.
- Set up **Dockerized ROS environments** and simulation pipelines for scalable testing.

### üß† Embedded Software Intern @ WDI Wise Device
- Developed **C++/TCP** integrations for controlling smart microscope hardware through a centralized interface.
- Created a **Python-based ML classification system** for **wafer defect detection**, reducing false positives by **90%**.
- Built a **Flask/Dash web dashboard** connected to an **FPGA sensor interface**, saving 3 hours/day of manual analysis.
